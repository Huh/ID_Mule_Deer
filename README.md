## Idaho Mule Deer Plotting Functions

This repository serves as a place to store plotting functions related to mule deer survival research in Idaho.

# Using the code
The functions in this repository assume that you have data stored in dropbox.  Within the shared MarkSurv folder several other folders are required.

- *model_out* This folder contains the R workspaces that were created by running the models
- *plot_in* This folder contains only jags objects from the model_out workspaces.  The objects should be stored using the model names.
- *data*  The data folder contains spatial objects used for map creation.
 
To run the code navigate to one of the workflow scripts in this repositories top most level.  Click on the workflow you want to perform and then click on the Raw button.  The code can be copied and pasted into R from this webpage.
